# Pythonic-Solutions-for-GIS-in-Civil-Eng


This repo consists of ad hoc Python scripts I wrote in my Civil Engineering roles to solve very specific GIS problems. 
Often, the problem was designing a clever way to use the tools provided to automate largely manual and laborious tasks that were standard of my roles. 

Some of these scripts were the first real applications I had surmised using Python, and my roles never actually required any programming.
Therefore, they may lack some best practices. I decided to include them as I feel they show creativity and the initiative to find better
solutions that work smarter rather than harder even when there was no such obligation to do so. 

The gif and screenshot below highlight clever use of the ArcPy Select By Location function to solve a practical problem I discovered 
with civil engineering GIS data at Buchart Horn:

This is a highligt from my first experimentation using Python to automate a complex data conflation task at GAI Consultants
