This repo consists of ad hoc Python scripts I wrote in my Civil Engineering roles to solve very specific GIS problems. 
Often, the problem was designing a clever way to use the tools provided to automate largely manual and laborious tasks that were standard of my roles. 

Some of these scripts were the first real applications I had surmised using Python, and my roles never actually required any programming.
Therefore, they may lack some best practices. I decided to include them as I feel they show creativity and the initiative to find better
solutions that work smarter rather than harder even when there was no such obligation to do so.
