This project was purely an initiative of my own will. I saw a great challenge that, while not a requirement of my position, 
had the potential to largely automate a previously manual set of tasks. It simply needed someone to take the time to sit down, brainstorm the tools available, 
and derive a unique and novel protocol that used those tools jointly and intelligently. I was excited to try my hand at this. 

This resulted in a script that was successful in automating the digitizing and attribute transfer from data taken in the field into their corresponding geospatial 
features in an ArcGIS database (this was previously done manually). The end of the presentation includes a page that measures efficiency and accuracy concluding accuracy 
levels between 95-100% and rates of speed that vastly exceed that of manual work. 

The presentation was done only for people who already are familiar with the work and was not done for a general audience. Still, you may be able to glean the gist 
by briefly scrolling through and taking a quick look at the script. It is important to note that this was my first instance of using Python in a complex manner outside 
of tutorials, and as such some best practices in the code may be absent. Effectively, I consider it a legacy project. Still, it shows a great amount of creativity and 
initiative and this should not be understated.
